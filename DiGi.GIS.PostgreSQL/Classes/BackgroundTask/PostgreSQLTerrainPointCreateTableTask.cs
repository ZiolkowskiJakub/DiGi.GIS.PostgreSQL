    /// <para>The work is driven per county code rather than by one grid over the whole area. A county held in several pieces is one row per piece sharing one code, so its pieces are walked as one group: the county's subdivisions are read once, the pieces' own outlines are read once, and each point is then decided in memory against both - against the subdivisions for whether it is on land at all, and against the pieces for which piece contains it, which is the partition it is filed under. A point costs no database round trip at all, where deciding it through the database costs six of them plus the deserializing of an outline of thousands of vertices.</para>
    /// <para>Every county is sampled on tiles cut from one grid shared by all of them, anchored by <see cref="PostgreSQLTerrainPointCreateTableOptions.OriginX"/> and <see cref="PostgreSQLTerrainPointCreateTableOptions.OriginY"/>. Neighbouring counties therefore produce the same coordinates for a shared point instead of two grids that do not line up, and a tile that was already sampled is recognised and skipped - so a run that was stopped resumes, and a county sampled coarsely can later be sampled finely without paying for the points it already holds.</para>

A county or a tile that cannot be sampled is counted in <see cref="FailedBatchCount"/>, logged with the exception that caused it, and stepped over - so a run of many hours is not reduced to a single word by one batch out of hundreds of thousands, and what did go wrong is named in the log rather than inferred from a count nothing reads.</para>
