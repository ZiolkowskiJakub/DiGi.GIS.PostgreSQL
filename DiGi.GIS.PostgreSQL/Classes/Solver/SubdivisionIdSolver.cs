    /// <para>Built once per county over the subdivision rows whose boxes meet the county's, and reused for every building of that county: set <see cref="Input"/> to the building, call <see cref="Solve"/>, read <see cref="Output"/>. The database path re-read and deserialised every overlapping subdivision polygon per building - in Warsaw the 412 KB city outline 155 307 times - and intersected the building with each; that ran at about 26 buildings a second, a week for the estate (<see href="https://github.com/ZiolkowskiJakub/DiGi.GIS.PostgreSQL/issues/79">DiGi.GIS.PostgreSQL#79</see>).</para>
    /// <para>The pick is the one of <c>Query.SubdivisionId</c>: among the candidates whose box meets the building's, the largest overlap wins, ties go to the smallest container, then the lowest identifier; a single candidate is taken as it stands. Containment is decided from the building's outline vertices through a <see cref="PolygonalFace2DPointRelationSolver"/> per subdivision - every vertex inside or on the polygon means the overlap is the building's own area, which is what every container of a nested layer scores - and only a building straddling a boundary is intersected. A concavity of a subdivision boundary narrower than a building could slip between two inside vertices unseen; the pick is a rule for attributing a building to one unit, not a survey, and that is accepted.</para>
    /// <para><see cref="Solve"/> answers false when the layer holds no subdivision whose box meets the building's - the building may sit outside the layer loaded, or in a place only an <see cref="GIS.Classes.AdministrativeDivision"/> covers - and the caller falls back to the database path for it.
