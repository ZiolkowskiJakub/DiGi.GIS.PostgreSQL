The BDOT10k settlement layer (<c>OT_ADMS_A</c>) and the administrative-division layer (<c>OT_ADJA_A</c>) are digitised independently, so a handful of settlements sit just outside every municipality polygon and their sample point lands in a gap. Requiring a majority - rather than any overlap - leaves a destination whose level genuinely holds no parent unassigned, so the caller can search the next level up instead of filing it under a neighbour it merely shares a border with.
