A building that arrives with a stored model gets a row in which every empty bucket is 0, so a zero row and an absent row stay distinguishable.</para>

That method states the selection rule for every consumer: a component bounding exactly one space is external, one bounding two is an internal partition, one bounding none is part of no envelope. Every envelope face carries the <see cref="DiGi.Core.Interfaces.IUniqueReference"/> of the component it was built from, which is how a face is matched back to its component; a component the envelope carries is classified from its face, one it does not carry is excluded from the external area and counted in the result when it bounds two spaces, and is a defect in the model’s space structure otherwise - a component bounding one space that the envelope still leaves out has no polygonal face.</para>
        /// <para>A model that carries components but no envelope at all - fewer than the four external faces a closed solid needs, typically a sliver footprint with walls and no roof or floor - is degenerate: nothing gives its components an outward normal, so it gets no row and its reference is listed in <see cref="ExternalComponentsAreaResult.DegenerateReferences"/>. A model refused as a defect gets no row either and is listed with its reason in <see cref="ExternalComponentsAreaResult.FailedReferences"/>; neither stops the classification of the other models, and neither leaves a partial row, because a row is only built once its model is classified.</para>
        /// <para>The finest tolerance at which the envelope edge-pairs into a closed surface is recorded beside the areas - the closing tolerance column, null when the envelope closes at no rung of the ladder 1e-6 to 0.2 m or the model carries no external components. Ray parity is sound only for a closed face set, so a null closing tolerance is the signal that the row’s sector and tilt values may rest on an arbitrary face side; such a model is counted in the result, not failed.</para>
        /// <para>A component the method cannot classify - a wall whose normal is vertical, so its azimuth is undefined - is skipped and counted in the result.</para>
        /// <para>A reference can arrive several times (several stored versions of the model); the first record of a given county and reference is the one that is written and the rest are stepped over, so the collection has to reach this method in the caller’s order of preference - the converter returns the newest record first.</para>
