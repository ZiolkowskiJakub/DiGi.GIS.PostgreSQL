The overlap decides only where the building straddles a boundary. Among the candidates whose overlap is the largest, within <paramref name="tolerance"/> of one another, the <b>smallest container</b> wins: the most specific unit the building sits in, and the one unit the per-building consumers - occupancy, building data - need exactly one of. The identifier is the last resort, for two candidates that are the same size to the tolerance.</para>
