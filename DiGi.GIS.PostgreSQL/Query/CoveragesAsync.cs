The column files a building under one subdivision only, so where the subdivision layer nests it cannot say which buildings a district holds - Warsaw's districts counted zero by column while holding 155 307 buildings between them (<see href="https://github.com/ZiolkowskiJakub/DiGi.GIS.PostgreSQL/issues/77">DiGi.GIS.PostgreSQL#77</see>).

        /// <para>The two tables live in different databases - <c>building_2d</c> in the main store, <c>orto_datas</c> in the storage one - so this cannot be a join and is not one.
