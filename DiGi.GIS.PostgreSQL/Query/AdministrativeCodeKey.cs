        /// <para>A code carries the whole chain above it: the first 2 characters name the voivodeship, the first 4 the county, and the first 6 the municipality. The 7th character of a municipality code is the gmina <i>type</i> digit - a town and the rural area of one urban-rural gmina carry <c>4</c> and <c>5</c> against the gmina's own <c>3</c> - so the municipality slice is 6 characters, not the whole code. Verified against the stored table: every one of the 100 354 subdivision rows carries a 7-character code whose 4-character prefix is an existing county code, and 99.72% of the rows that already resolved agree with their municipality at 6 characters.</para>
        /// <para>Returns <see langword="null"/> for <see cref="AdministrativeArealType.Country"/>, which has no such relation - every country row's code is <c>10</c>, which is also the voivodeship code of łódzkie, so slicing 2 characters there would match one voivodeship's chain rather than the country. A caller that gets <see langword="null"/> has no code constraint to apply and must fall back to searching the whole level.</para>
        /// <para><b>A code is not a key.</b> 18 county codes and 64 municipality codes name several rows, one per polygon part, so a slice identifies a <i>set</i> of candidate rows and geometry still has to choose between them.
